spacebook invaders
==================

hackny spring 2014. space invaders-style game + people from your facebook.

this ended up being a mess of a thing and turned into more of a joke project after we realized how difficult dartemis is to work with. dart the language is pretty okay though.

we won "best pitch" I think, thanks to wayne's brilliant salesmanship. if i had gone up there by myself it literally would have been the worst project there. 

also for some reason the compiled js version doesn't run on firefox, but it worked on wayne's laptop in chrome and on the dartvm in dartium.
